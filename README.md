# Project Title

## Overview
This repository contains the setup and configuration for the Jenkins pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment process for the application.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the Jenkins pipeline, make sure you have the following:
- **Jenkins** installed and running.
- **Git** installed and accessible.
- A **GitHub repository** with the code to build.
- **Jenkins plugins** for Git integration, pipeline execution, and any specific build or deployment tasks you use (e.g., Docker, Maven, etc.).
- **Jenkinsfile** placed in the root of the repository for pipeline configuration.

## Pipeline Overview
This project includes a Jenkins pipeline with the following stages:
1. **Build**: Compile and build the application.
2. **Test**: Run unit tests and integration tests.
3. **Deploy**: Deploy the application to the staging or production environment.

## Jenkins Setup
To set up Jenkins for this pipeline:
1. **Create a Jenkins job** that points to this repository.
2. **Set up GitHub integration** in Jenkins, so it can pull the latest code.
3. **Ensure Jenkins has access to the necessary credentials** for deployment (e.g., AWS, Docker, etc.).
4. **Create and configure the Jenkinsfile** for the pipeline.

## Steps to Set Up Jenkins Pipeline
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone it to your Jenkins instance.
3. Set up your pipeline with the Jenkinsfile from the repository.
4. Configure the necessary environment variables, build tools, and credentials.
5. Trigger the pipeline manually or set it to trigger on GitHub events (like a commit or pull request).

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to adjust the Jenkinsfile for your project’s specific needs.
- For deployment, ensure you have the right environment and configuration set up (e.g., cloud access for AWS, Docker setup, etc.).
